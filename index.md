Alex Ranc (He/Him) recently graduated with a B.A. in History. Alexâ€™s research focuses on 20th Century United States Foreign Relations and International Politics. Alex's latest researh project invovles analyzing the spread and impact of 'Canalitis,' an infectious enthusiasm that surrounded the construction of the Panama Canal, on the American public and immigrant communities in Chicago during the early 20th Century.

Alex's research goals are largely formed by whimsy at the moment, though feature an increasing focus on the late 20th century at the end and just after the end of the Cold War.
